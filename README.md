# Fight Night!

## T1A3 - Terminal Application

As part of my Term 1 Assignment 3 I have decided to create a turn based battle simulator game where players will enter a boxing tournament and fight in three consecutive matches against CPU opponents. 

Upon winning all three matches, the player will be crowned World Boxing Champion!

## Code Style Guide

My source code follows the PEP8 style guide and coding conventions. 

For more information on the PEP8 guidelines, please visit this [website](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

In terms of limitations, due to my game having significant text as part of the battle simulator, upgrade menu's and battle menus along with colored styling to prompt players when input's are required, certain line items exceed the 79 character limit. 

I have used substitutions of different variables to reduce character limits for styling coventions within the 'colored' package, however character limits are still high. 

## Launch Guide

### Terminal Application:

This application can be run on any system that has it's own Terminal Application. For those using Windows, you will require the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run the application. 

Please follow this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for guidelines on how to install WSL as well as Ubuntu onto your desktop. 

### Python:

Next, we will need to ensure that you have a version python installed.
In your terminal, enter the following:



    python3 --version


To run this application smoothly, we will require a python version of 3.10 or later. For reference, your terminal output should show something like the following:



    Python 3.10.12



If you do not have python installed or require a later version, please use this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions to download the latest official version of python. 

### Clone Repository and Run:

You can access the repository directly [here](https://github.com/Shalulu94/Feb24-T1A3-Terminal-App) or alternatively copy and paste the following code into your terminal application:



    git clone https://github.com/Shalulu94/Feb24-T1A3-Terminal-App.git

This will download all of the necessary files onto your device. After that you simply need to paste in the below code to run the script:

    ./run.sh

If you encounter any issues, try entering the following code:

    chmod +x run.sh

Now retry running the run script above. 

Enjoy!
