# Fight Night!

## T1A3 - Terminal Application

As part of my Term 1 Assignment 3 I have decided to create a turn based battle simulator game where players will enter a boxing tournament and fight in three consecutive matches against CPU opponents. 

Upon winning all three matches, the player will be crowned World Boxing Champion!

## Code Style Guide

My source code follows the PEP8 style guide and coding conventions. 

For more information on the PEP8 guidelines, please visit this [website](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

In terms of limitations, due to my game having significant text as part of the battle simulator, upgrade menu's and battle menus along with colored styling to prompt players when input's are required, certain line items exceed the 79 character limit. 

I have used a substitutions of different variables to reduce character limits for styling coventions within the 'colored' package, however character limits are still high.
